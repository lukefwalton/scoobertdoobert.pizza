# scoobertdoobert.pizza — PHASES (roadmap & status)

What's built, what's next, in what order. `CLAUDE.md` holds the rules you can't
break; `docs/DESIGN.md` holds the vision each phase serves; this file holds the
plan and the live status. **Agent-maintained — keep current.** Re-read each
session.

**Cadence (from the working agreement):** long-running build, **one PR per
chunk**, commit/push at each checkpoint, use the review bot as the feedback loop.
Each phase is its own branch + PR. Don't stop at every checkpoint for sign-off
unless the work is genuinely ambiguous.

Cross-cutting: the **persistence spine** (`progressStore`, localStorage) underpins
retention, the curdled copy, cleared-games, and dread's max-`unease` memory —
✅ landed, read by the terminal + dread + the curdled-copy gate.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 — Storefront + descent + first room (COMPLETE, 2026-06-20)
Dead-plain HTML storefront (the fallback layer, JS-off + crawlable), `links.ts` /
`/text` / pizza cursor / 2026 JSON-LD + meta; the boot+audio shell; the descent
(CRT/aging pass, SCOOBERT.EXE crash fakeout, Calzone Player™ install, the world
fade-up); the PS1 beach-shop room (boids + degraded water, FP controls); three
hotspots + the Esc pause menu; mobile/reduced-motion → `/text`. Plus, post-Phase-1:
real degraded boot music, press photos + OG image, the `/links` archive, lazy/
gated audio, opt-in email capture (`api/order.ts` → Vercel Blob).

## ✅ Phase 2 — Era-floor descent + machine room (COMPLETE)
The descent is data-driven (`src/data/floors.ts` + `src/floors/`): storefront →
1999 starburst → 2000 table-layout (section-gate + pizza image-map gags) → the
**SGI machine room** (parody "Pizza Graphics Workstation", starfield, chrome
word-art, a corner **CRT showing a live mini-render** of water+boids). The Calzone
install **relocated here**; on complete the camera pushes through the CRT into the
beach shop. Lazy three.js throughout.

## ✅ Phase 3 — THE WORLD GROWS (COMPLETE)
The world went from one room to a **graph joined by 3D doors** (`src/data/
rooms.ts`, three-free). beach shop (`ROOMS[0]`) ⇄ **rat hallway** (3D-Maze brick)
⇄ **jukebox room**, with the hidden **classified room** the rat knocks open.
- ✅ ckpt1 rooms system + 3D doors (`Doors.tsx`, black-wipe transitions,
  room-aware `Controls`).
- ✅ ckpt2 jukebox room + the music swell (proximity duck via
  `audio.setProximityGain`). **Shipped: a real cycling catalog** — an 18-track
  aquatic set in `public/audio/jukebox/*.mp3` (optimized MP3, **no WAV ships** —
  the repo is WAV-free), tape-warbled low-bitrate loops rendered from
  `src/data/jukebox.catalog.json` by `scripts/make-jukebox-audio.mjs`; click the
  jukebox to cycle, and a user track-switcher (`src/data/music.ts` CUES +
  `musicStore`). (drei `<PositionalAudio>` swap can still drop in at `JUKEBOX_POS`.)
- ✅ ckpt3 the rat (`src/world/Rat.tsx`, one steering agent — leads, then flees).
- ✅ ckpt4 the secret (rat knocks a panel → `revealSecret()` → hidden door → the
  X-Files **classified room** of rejected demos).
- ✅ **ckpt5 — mobile pass + README.** Closed by the **"make the whole thing work
  on mobile"** work: the 3D world now runs on phones with on-screen touch controls
  (`TouchControls` + `touchInput.ts` → the shared `Controls`/`worldActions`), the
  `lib/lowPower` gate is split so `isTouchDevice()` (coarse pointer, any
  orientation) only picks the touch HUD, and
  `prefers-reduced-motion` became an opt-in (`MotionConsent`, `/text` as the safe
  default) instead of a hard `/text` redirect. Also fixed a stray leva default
  panel that overlapped the ☰ menu button on phones. Covered by `shoot:touch`
  (drives the world at 390×844) + updated `shoot:descent` / `shoot:fallback`.

---

## ✅ Phase 4 — THE TERMINAL (COMPLETE)
A hidden SGI/X-Files command line, summoned by the **backtick (`` ` ``)** key
anywhere (storefront, every floor, the world) — mounted on the storefront shell
(`Terminal.tsx`), so it's a pure post-hydration enhancement that never touches the
crawlable / JS-off page. Commands are data (`src/data/commands.ts`): `help`, a
dead-web `ls`/`cat` fake filesystem, `about`, hidden eggs (`rat`, `1101`,
`mobius`, `pizza`), and **forbidden** ones (`sudo`/`rm`/`unlock`/`kill`) that fire
the `terminal-forbidden-cmd` `unease` bump — the live Phase-4→5 bridge.
- **Persistence link (the "site remembers you", made legible):** `status` and a
  recognising `whoami` read the durable `progressStore` snapshot (depth, rooms,
  secrets, visits) via `CommandCtx.progress`; summoning the terminal records
  `findSecret('terminal')`. Verified by `shoot:terminal` (incl. the JS-off
  crawlable guarantee).

---

## ✅ Phase 5 — THE DREAD LAYER (the `unease` conductor) — BUILT
**The full spec lives in `docs/DESIGN.md` → "The dread layer."** This is a
*modulation* layer: it builds **no new place**, it wires one `unease` value
(0→1) to knobs that already exist. If you're writing a new system, you've left
Phase 5 — stop. Honor **both** guardrails, especially the taste one.

**Live:** the conductor (`DreadConductor` rAF + `dread.ts` score) drives `unease`
from zone base + dwell/decay, records the high-water mark to persistence, and
feeds the audio sub-bass bed (`setDreadLevel`), the PS1/fog visual ramp
(`DreadVisuals`/`DreadVignette`), the rat's inversion (`Rat.tsx`), and the
persistence-gated curdled copy (`selectDeepDiver`). The terminal's forbidden
commands + the Möbius/dice pokes are wired triggers.
- **Deep-room coverage:** `baseUnease` now tunes every deep room (dicepit, mobius,
  liminal, deeppool, metro-tunnel) — the shrine stays a *sweet* relief beat
  (below SAFE, so it decays). Before this the post-ckpt1 rooms read dead-safe.
- **Safety guard:** a brickwall **output limiter** (`DynamicsCompressorNode`,
  master → limiter → destination) sits across ALL audio, so no sum of sources or
  sudden onset can spike the speakers (WCAG 2.3.1 audio rule + ears). Covered by
  `shoot:dread` alongside the dosage curve (sweet surface/shrine, bitter deep).

Build in this order, checkpoint at each. **Trim point:** steps 1–3 are the
viable spine (audio bed + visual ramp make it visceral). Ship 1–3, then the rat,
then the CRT beat. Don't expand a step to compensate.

1. **The conductor.** `src/data/dread.ts` (`baseUnease` per room, `dwellRate`,
   `decayRate`, `triggers`) + an `unease` value in zustand, driven by depth /
   dwell / triggers, decaying in safe zones. Expose `unease` + its mapped targets
   in `leva` to drive it manually. *Checkpoint: I watch `unease` rise deep / fall
   near the surface, and can force it with a slider.* Live triggers: depth, dwell,
   classified room, machine room. Dormant (declared): terminal commands (Phase 4),
   the Möbius loop.
2. **Audio dread bed (the centerpiece — spend the most time here).** Sub-bass bed
   scaled by `unease` (with **missing-fundamental** harmonics at 2×/3× so phone
   speakers imply the low pitch); wow/flutter + bitcrush curve; *rare* dropouts
   that **fade back, never spike**; one behind-you positional cue; **mobile
   haptics** as the chest-thump on phones. All respect mute. *Checkpoint: at high
   unease I feel it before I see anything; surface zones sound fine.*
3. **Visual ramp.** Wire PS1 shader uniforms (vertex jitter, affine, color depth,
   dither), fog density, camera bob/shake, vignette to `unease`; the rare
   one-frame dim/small/low-contrast peripheral shape. **WCAG 2.3.1** holds
   (≤3 flashes/s, no full-field flash). *Checkpoint: the world destabilizes
   smoothly deep, calm at the surface.*
   - ⚠️ **Pre-req to verify when starting step 3:** confirm the PS1 params in
     `src/world/ps1.ts` are live, per-frame-animatable **uniforms** (not baked
     constants). If baked, lifting them to uniforms is part of this step.
4. **The rat turns.** Drive its boids weights from `unease` (cute/guiding → stops,
   faces you, doesn't flee). Same agent, inverted. *Checkpoint: deep + lingering,
   the rat stops being friendly.*
5. **Hero beat + curdled copy.** The machine-room CRT renders **a faked low-poly
   figure of the player** (render-to-texture, **never a real camera**). One
   curdled line of existing copy, **gated on persistence** (only a returning
   deep-diver sees it): "An employee will call to verify your order. An employee
   is already inside." The single set-piece — don't add more.
6. **README:** how the curve is tuned (`dread.ts`), and the hard rules (surface
   zones never enter dread; no real camera/mic ever).

---

## ✅ Phase 6 — World-content (LARGELY SHIPPED)
These extend THE WORLD GROWS (detailed in `docs/DESIGN.md`); content/systems, not
the dread layer (which modulates each). Most of this is now live behind the
descent, each covered by a `shoot:*` smoke:

- ✅ **Persistence spine** (`src/state/progressStore.ts`, localStorage): depth,
  max-`unease`, secrets, rooms, cleared games → returning visitors get a
  quietly-changed world. The terminal's `status`/`whoami` read it.
- ✅ **GLB levels below the shop** — lazy-loaded PS1-crunched levels: the
  poolrooms → liminal space → the deep **abandoned pool** (`shoot:levels`,
  `shoot:deeppool`), the **backrooms-vr** terminus. Each shipped model has a
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` entry (enforced by `scripts/check-build.mjs`).
- ✅ **The loader layer** — `LevelLoader` covers each GLB load with a calm panel
  and AUTO-ENTERS the instant it resolves (the old tap-to-enter tracker minigame
  was removed — loads are fast enough that it broke the flow), with a graceful
  TURN BACK on load failure. The shared smoke flow lives in `scripts/lib/smoke.mjs`.
- ✅ **Recurrence / the Möbius loop** (`MobiusRoom`, `shoot:mobius`): one corridor,
  comic at low unease → oppressive deep; breaks open after N laps. Not a fail-maze.
- ✅ **Wayside shrine → undersea metro → "End of the Line"** — the shrine (sweet
  relief beat) follows the tracks into the **metro tunnel** (Seikan/青函 neon,
  shitty-shinkansen pass; `shoot:metro`) out into the backrooms **terminus**
  (`shoot:terminus`).
- ✅ **The d20 + dice monster** (`DicePitRoom`/`DiceMonster`, `shoot:dice`/
  `shoot:monster`): roll-off; lose → it grows → walk around it.
- ✅ **The practice room** (`PracticeRoom`, `shoot:practice`): a door-game +
  instrument room — the first "play it" rung; clearing it promotes a demo to your
  preferred jukebox track. (Also the junction down to the **Basement Sessions**
  studio wing — Phase 8.)
- ✅ **Poke Scoobert** (`FaceStretch`, `/poke`): the face-stretch instrument —
  pull-and-hold warps his own sample live (touch-first).

**Remaining tail (small):**
- ✅ **`fun` instruments — borrowed by VENDORING (the repo stays standalone).**
  Rather than submodule the `fun` playground, the two pure-synthesis instruments
  were ported and **re-homed as our own files**; the `fun/` breadcrumb dir has
  since been removed (Luke's ask), its provenance kept in the source headers
  (`src/lib/chimes.ts` / `cultures.ts`). Shipped as
  touch-first arcade cabinets: **`/chimes`** (Pendulum Chimes — `src/lib/chimes.ts`
  + `ChimesCabinet`) and **`/cultures`** (the DNA cell-drone — `src/lib/cultures.ts`
  + `CulturesCabinet`), both synthesised, mute-aware, brickwall-limited, crawlable,
  covered by `shoot:chimes` / `shoot:cultures`. **The bell synth is a reusable
  engine** (`strikeBell` → `audio.playChime`): it also rings the **furin** in the
  Wayside Shrine — the first "use the ENGINE for in-room effects" (Luke). ✅ The
  deep instrument ROOM (vs. surface cabinet) landed — **The Aerial**, a proximity-
  played theremin off the liminal (Phase 8, 2026-06-29). ⬜ More in-room/"odd-thing"
  uses remain; the webcam stays its own gated thread (DESIGN → Webcam policy).
- ⬜/❓ **The Doom / Freedoom shrine — likely DROPPED.** The point of it (a hidden,
  lazy, dread-tinged liminal level) is effectively already delivered by our OWN
  GLB levels (deep pool / liminal / backrooms) — without taking on Freedoom's
  copyleft + provenance burden. Only revisit if we specifically want the *Doom
  grammar*; otherwise leave it unbuilt. (`/about` is intentionally NOT on the
  roadmap — out of scope, per Luke.)

---

## ✅ Phase 8 — THE GAME LAYER (core shipped, 2026-06-21)
The "let's make a damn game" pivot (Luke). Full spec in `docs/DESIGN.md` → "The
game layer." DESIGN pillar #6's "no stats / no HUD" was lifted (`CLAUDE.md`
ADDENDUM 7); the taste/WCAG/crawlable lines are untouched.
- ✅ **Universal d20** (`src/lib/luck.ts`, unit-tested): luck-biased rolls, **nat
  20 / crit fail as a 3× swing across the board.** Luck buys advantage; the system
  spends it (never the player).
- ✅ **LUCK stat** (`progressStore`, durable): earned at the **shrine clap** (二拍手),
  **shown in the pause menu**, **announced on gain** (`toastStore` + `WorldHud`).
- ✅ **First dice-combat:** the goblin bout (`D20`/`DicePitRoom`/`monsterStore`) is
  crit-aware — nat 20 auto-wins + +3 luck, crit fail bloats it 3×. `shoot:luck`.
- ✅ **Inventory + keys (engagement pass):** durable `itemsHeld` (`progressStore`),
  a pause-menu **"Pockets"** list, `ItemPickup` collectibles (`Room.pickups`), and
  **locked doors** (`RoomDoor.requiresKey`) via the shared lock-aware `enterDoor`
  (`src/lib/doorTravel.ts`). First loop: the rusted key on the poolrooms deck opens
  a **Staff Locker Room** (a safe side nook, +2 luck on first entry). Keys may only
  gate **side/secret** doors — a dev guard + `MAIN_DESCENT` set reject any
  `requiresKey` on the descent (friction budget). `shoot:keys`, `doorTravel.test`.
- ✅ **Dancing entities (engagement pass):** `Wanderer` roams the GLB liminal
  levels (liminal / deeppool / metro-tunnel / terminus, `Room.entities`) and
  **dances** when you get close — never attacks (taste/WCAG: gentle, capped under
  reduced-motion, GLB-only). `shoot:entities`.
- ✅ **Arrival-spawn contract guard:** fixed grove/frutiger spawning ON their exit
  prompt; `spawnFacingInward` + a dev guard + `rooms.test` assert every spawn lands
  clear of, and facing away from, its doors (the "wrong side of the map" fix).
- ✅ **The Boardwalk wing (world-content):** a sweet SoCal **surface** branch off
  the shop (a +X screen door, NOT the descent) — **The Boardwalk** (golden-hour
  pier over the crunchy sea), **Moonlight Beach** (a moonlit sit-and-watch
  breather), and a **Park Path** (the Balboa fountain). Introduces **`Room.song`**:
  a room owns the loop voice while you're in it (a `jukebox.catalog` slug) and
  hands it back on exit (`musicStore.restorePreferred`) — "exploration's reward is
  sound," no new collectible. Reuses the shipped `Water` (now tint/placement-
  configurable), `palm-tree`/`arcade-cabinet` props. `shoot:boardwalk`,
  `music.test` Room.song guard. Surface stays sweet (taste guardrail).
- ✅ **The Sunken Gallery wing (world-content):** a submerged vaporwave-classical
  hall off the poolrooms — **The Sunken Gallery** (a colonnade of **crunched greek
  GLBs** from the trove: doric + ionic columns, a centre sculpture, a broken
  statue, amphorae; knee-deep flood, dim teal, funny-uncanny) opening onto
  **Daydream** (a pastel watercolor-sky breather — the taste-guardrail contrast).
  Both song-rooms (`underwater` / `watercolor-sky`). Crunched via the documented
  `gltf-transform optimize … --texture-size 256` pipeline; `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
  rows added; IP-flagged trove models still excluded. `shoot:gallery`.
- ✅ **The greek lyre — a "play it" instrument in the Sunken Gallery (2026-06-25):**
  a procedural, pluckable 7-string lyre (`GreekLyre.tsx`) set among the statuary
  (it mirrors the broken statue across the nave). Each string is a pentatonic note
  played through the shared bell engine (mute-aware + limited); original parody
  geometry, no sourced model. Advances the music ladder's "play it" rung in a deep
  room. `shoot:gallery` now plucks a string.
- ✅ **The pizza pan chimes — a "play it" instrument in the park (2026-06-27):** the
  SURFACE, sweet counterpart to the gallery lyre — a busker rack of tuned PIZZA PANS
  (`PizzaPanChimes.tsx`) in the Park Path (`balboa`), the site's pizza→music thesis
  made playable. Six pans, a C-pentatonic ladder (naturals → no wrong notes), each
  struck (click or the `__sdpStrikePan` hook) rings a bell-pluck through the shared
  engine (mute-aware + limited) and swings/glows the pan. Self-lit emissive so the
  metal reads against the behind-it sun; original parody geometry. `shoot:boardwalk`
  now strikes a pan (asserts the E4 note via `__sdpPans`).
- ✅ **The Basement Sessions wing — a 4-room recording studio (2026-06-27):** the
  biggest album-themed wing yet, down off the **practice room** ("backstage, where
  the records get MADE"). A hub **Live Room** (warm tracking room) branches to the
  **Control Room** (slanted mixing desk + reel-to-reel decks + a window onto the live
  room) → the **Tape Vault** (a hushed archive of shelved reels), and a sweet
  **Lounge** breather (couch, bobbing lava lamp, the rat asleep in the good armchair,
  a CRT playing "Finding SD"). The play-it ladder's biggest beat: the Live Room mounts
  a **playable 3-piece band** — a 6-piece **DrumKit** (rhythm), a 4-string
  **StudioBass** (a low C-arpeggio bottom end), and an 8-key C-pentatonic
  **StudioKeys** (melody), all locked to one C tonality (no wrong notes) and rung
  through the shared bell engine (mute-aware + limited), original parody geometry,
  deterministic strike hooks. **Song
  design (a real studio breathes):** the two "playing" rooms sing (`Room.song`: live =
  `mystery-machine`, lounge = `jolly-roger-bay`); the two "working" rooms stay hushed
  so `information` + `1101` stay jukebox SEEDS — and their **master tapes** are
  collectible in the vault (3 `trinket` items + `Room.pickups`, each plays its track on
  pickup + feeds the lost-cassettes quest). Lore-true: he tracked a whole LP alone (the
  bathrobe slung on the mic stand) and Finding SD was written/recorded/mixed/mastered
  in a single day (the framed gold record = every fader his own hand). The wing's
  **"discover" rung:** tuck the blanket over the sleeping rat for a sweet one-time
  secret (`lounge-rat` + luck) — the storefront's "RAT SPOTTED IN WALL" tease finally
  paid off (taste: you never wake it). 4 mined whispers, pause-menu minimap coords,
  `shoot:studio` (tours all 4 rooms, plays all three instruments, collects a master
  tape, tucks in the rat, asserts the working rooms stay hushed, walks every door both
  ways, proves the pocketed station carries back to the storefront); `rooms.test` /
  `music.test` / `jukebox.test` guards.
- ✅ **D&D mechanics — the trap-door luck-d20 (2026-06-26):** the chute is a real
  luck-biased d20 (`rollD20(true)` + `trapDropForRoll`): the face ordinally picks
  WHERE you drop (unluckiest → luckiest room), a nat 20 drops you somewhere sweet
  and a nat 1 somewhere wrong, each with a crit flourish. `shoot:trapdoor`.
- ✅ **Spells — earn one, cast it (2026-06-26):** you can now learn a spell from a
  found scroll and cast it. **Fireball** (a WCAG-safe AoE that lights the room) and
  **Light** (a cantrip glow) live in `src/data/spells.ts`; casting spends a slot
  (two monotonic counters in `progressStore`), **rest restores slots** (shrine clap
  / breather rooms), and a cast feeds the dread-**relief** pool — a sanctioned way
  to push the unease back. Multi-spell hotbar in the HUD. `shoot:spell`.
- ✅ **Perception whispers (2026-06-26):** each room entry rolls a **plain d20
  perception check** (DC 12; luck stays reserved for the stakes rolls, so a
  high-frequency check never drains it); on a hit you catch a room-specific whisper
  (lore mined from lukefwalton.com, so the repo stays standalone). `shoot:whisper`.
- ✅ **Luck you can SEE + the shrine おみくじ (2026-07-07, Luke: "turn luck into
  clearer outcomes; more chances for BAD or GREAT; more ways to ROLL"):** three
  moves that make the invisible luck economy legible and give the d20 more surfaces.
  - **The payoff is visible now.** The universal roll (`luck-core.ts` `Roll`) reports
    the NATURAL die + a `lucky` flag (advantage actually raised the result), and a
    shared `luckTag(roll)` appends "· 🍀 luck tipped it (4→18)" to the announce toast
    wherever luck is spent — the dice-monster bout, the grass-goblin battle, the
    storefront trap door. Luck stops happening silently in the backend; you watch it
    rescue a roll. (This is legibility, NOT a spend menu — the system still spends it
    for you; CLAUDE.md ADDENDUM 7 holds.)
  - **おみくじ at the shrine — a real BAD↔GREAT roll you trigger.** A fortune-draw
    stand beside the offering box (`ShrineRoom` `OmikujiStand` + `src/data/omikuji.ts`
    pure mapper): a luck-biased universal d20 draws a paper slip from 大吉 (great
    blessing) down to 凶 (a curse), announced with the reading + the luck tag. A
    blessing pays luck back (大吉 +2, 吉 +1); a 凶 is pure sweet theatre — the real
    omusubi custom, never a penalty (taste guardrail: the sweet shrine stays sweet,
    losing never hard-fails). Because the die is luck-biased, a luckier player draws
    better fortunes — the luck loop made a ritual. A new **bonus** objective, "Draw
    your fortune," gives luck a legible goal without moving the ★100% finale bar.
  - **Surfaced a silent roll.** The garden frog's per-ribbit d20 now lands a real
    BAD/GREAT beat both ways — a nat 20 still winks +1 luck, a nat 1 makes him blorp,
    mortified (sweet, no penalty). Covered by `shoot:luck` (the draw → toast + secret),
    `omikuji.test.ts` / `luck-core.test.ts` / `luck.test.ts` (raw/`lucky`/`luckTag`).
  - **…and they hang in the Trophy Case (2026-07-07, Luke: "can this hang in their
    trophy case? can it track pizza slices too?").** Two new durable stats feed the
    shop's reactive back-bar hall of fame (`ShopFittings`): **`bestFortune`** (your
    finest おみくじ rank, 1..5) hangs a framed slip on the upper shelf, and
    **`lootTotals`** (lifetime per-type loot counts, banked in `collectLootById`)
    grows a pizza-slice tally on the lower shelf — distinct from `pizzaPointsBest`
    (a single run's score) since it's the cumulative haul across every descent. The
    pause menu gets a "Trophy case" readout too (the full per-type breakdown + best
    fortune). Both trophies are value-keyed textures (≤128px, disposed on change),
    gated so they only appear once earned; `shoot:trophy` seeds + mounts them,
    `progressStore.test` covers `recordFortune` (monotonic) + `addLoot` (per-type,
    fresh-disk accumulate). Also folded in PR #123's review: the omikuji slip texture
    dropped 128×160 → 96×128 (the hard PS1 ≤128px cap), the 大吉 note-burst timers are
    cancelled on unmount (no cross-room audio bleed), and `shoot:luck`'s fixed sleeps
    became concrete state waits.
- ✅ **The jukebox dice crits — the "gamble for it" payoff (2026-06-26):** the music
  ladder's top rung lands its crits. The cabinet d20 (`rollD20(false)`) already
  jumped the dial to the rolled track; now a **nat 20 = "the pristine pressing"**
  (sparkle) and a **nat 1 = "the cursed pressing"** (a detuned womp + `crit-bad`
  toast) — DESIGN's share-fuel beat, goofy-sweet (taste). `shoot:dice` forces both.
- ✅ **The grass encounter (in DESIGN, now shipped):** a **rare Pokémon-style
  grass-level encounter** vs the wild goblin — the field mounts, the encounter fades
  to a battle room, and winning the d20 roll-off opens the grove + records the
  unlock. `shoot:grass`.
- ✅ **The Grassrooms (草の間) + the 3D ghost race (2026-06-28, from Luke's
  r/LiminalSpace inspiration):** a **fully sweet liminal breather** off the
  `liminal` GLB level — the backrooms after nature wins (white office bones gone to
  grass + indoor trees + blue wildflowers, the low ceiling broken open to an
  impossibly blue sky), **sized as a 48×48 racecourse**. A `musicRoom` with its own
  wind + furin ambient; `baseUnease` below SAFE. Hosts **ゴーストレース / RACE THE
  GHOST** — a real in-world, first-person **lap race** against a floating ghost
  character (checkpoint gates, 3·2·1·GO countdown, hold SHIFT to sprint, first to 2
  laps; `raceStore` + `world/GhostRace` + `components/RaceHud`). Losing is an
  anticlimax + auto-rematch; winning gives +3 luck + the clear. Words stay EN + JP.
  `shoot:grassrooms` drives the countdown→racing→won state machine (+ the room
  graph/map/dread/whisper wiring; full unit suite green).
- ✅ **The Kitchen (厨房) — the thesis at its source (2026-06-28):** a warm,
  goofy **surface relief room** off the shop's **-X "EMPLOYEES ONLY" door** (a
  lateral side room, never the way down — the descent rule is untouched). Original
  parody PS1 geometry: a glowing brick oven (emissive mouth + a hot point light),
  a stainless prep counter with stacked dough boxes, a ceiling pot rail. The point:
  against the back wall, a rack of tuned **PIZZA PANS** you can play — the shipped
  `PizzaPanChimes` instrument reused — so the kitchen itself makes music (a pizza
  shop that is secretly a one-man music project, made literal where the pies AND
  the songs get made). Bilingual 厨房 / KITCHEN plaque; `baseUnease` 0 (stays
  sweet). Reuses `makeBilingualSign` + `useDispose` + `PizzaPanChimes` (elegant
  repo — no new instrument). `shoot:kitchen` drives the room + a pan strike; the
  room graph/map/dread/whisper wiring lands with the full unit suite green.
- ✅ **The Aerial (テルミン) — the deep theremin room (2026-06-29):** the music ladder's
  first SUSTAINED, continuously-pitched instrument and the long-flagged "deep instrument
  ROOM (vs. surface cabinet)." A hushed, starlit chamber off the **liminal** level's +X
  wall (a sweet relief beat — `musicRoom`, `baseUnease` below SAFE) holding one theremin
  you play BY PROXIMITY: walk into its field and it sings higher + louder, back away and
  it fades to silence (the real theremin mechanism, mapped onto first-person movement —
  no pointer-lock fight). The proximity→{freq,gain} curve is a pure, unit-tested mapping
  (`src/lib/theremin.ts`); the SOUND is a NEW reusable engine primitive —
  `audio.startVoice()` (a warm tri+sub under a gentle vibrato, mute-aware + brickwall-
  limited), the sustained counterpart to the struck/plucked one-shots. Original parody
  geometry; a faint floor ring marks the field; bilingual テルミン / THEREMIN plaque; a
  perception whisper ties the wordless air-played voice to his wordless KŌAN track 無門関.
  `shoot:theremin` drives the REAL per-frame proximity path (sings near → drops with
  distance → silent outside); `theremin.test` + `rooms.test` / `music.test` guards.
- ⬜ **Tail / backlog (in DESIGN):** further album-themed wings (the **Basement
  Sessions** studio wing is the first big one — shipped above). (Trap-door d20,
  spells, perception whispers, the grass encounter, storefront reactivity, the greek
  lyre, and the full arcade are all shipped.)
- ✅ **The arcade grew — three reskinned cabinets (2026-06-25):** **Crusteroids**
  (Asteroids), **Slice Breaker** (Breakout), **Jazz Snake** (Snake, every bite
  plays the next note of a climbing scale). Original code + procedural art + own
  audio, classic mechanics only (no marks; provenance in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`).
  Each is a self-contained `<canvas>` (no three.js), touch-first (an on-screen pad
  for the games that need one), with a **per-cabinet high score** (`arcadeHighs`
  map in `progressStore`, monotonic per id). They join the in-world cabinet's
  random roll (`arcadeGames.ts` + `ArcadeModal`) AND get standalone mobile routes
  (`/crusteroids`, `/slice-breaker`, `/jazz-snake`) through a shared, DRY
  `ArcadeCabinetPage` shell. Covered by `shoot:games` (JS-off crawlable + JS
  mounts/starts/persists) + `arcadeGames.test`.
- ✅ **…and completed — five cabinets (2026-06-26):** added **Pizza Radar 1996**
  (Space Invaders, green-phosphor) and **Burrito Belt** (a falling-blocks stacker
  with an on-screen held soft-drop for touch), filling out the shelf via the same
  plumbing — standalone routes (`/pizza-radar`, `/burrito-belt`) + the in-world roll.
  Their two RAF lose-rules were lifted into pure, unit-tested predicates
  (`arcadeRules.ts`) and their REAL game-over paths are exercised by `?debug`-only
  force-lose hooks in `shoot:games`. The cross-link shelf is now DERIVED from the
  registry and a route-parity test (`routes.test.ts`) guards `routes.tsx`, so the
  cabinet set can't drift across its parallel lists.
- ✅ **…and a sixth — Delivery Dash (2026-06-28):** a cross-the-traffic pizza-courier
  cabinet (Frogger grammar, original code/art/audio): hop the scooter up through five
  lanes of traffic to the door, deliver, and start again a notch faster; a clip ends
  the run. Same plumbing as the others — registry + `ArcadeModal` + the in-world roll
  + a standalone `/delivery-dash` route through `ArcadeCabinetPage`, a per-cabinet
  high score (`arcadeHighs['delivery-dash']`), and a `?debug`-only `__sdpDashForceLose`
  hook driving the real game-over branch in `shoot:games`.
- ✅ **…and a musical seventh — Order Up (2026-06-29):** a kitchen-side **Simon** — the
  cook calls a growing order on four singing topping pads (a C-major arpeggio rung
  through the SHARED bell engine `audio.playChime`, so it's mute-aware + brickwall-
  limited for free), you ring it back from memory, and one slip ends the shift. The
  music ladder as a memory game — "the reward is the melody you echo." Same DRY
  plumbing as the rest: one `arcadeGames.ts` registry row drives the in-world roll +
  the derived cross-link shelf + a standalone `/order-up` route through
  `ArcadeCabinetPage` (route-parity guarded), a per-cabinet high score
  (`arcadeHighs['order-up']` = the longest order reached), and a `?debug`-only
  `__sdpOrderUpForceLose` hook driving the real game-over branch in `shoot:games`.
- ✅ **…and the ARG payoff gets a cabinet — SAVE SAN DIEGO (2026-07-06, Luke):**
  the deepest secret finally has a front door in the arcade. **"1101 (Save San
  Diego)"** — Luke's own **Twine/Harlowe** interactive-fiction quest (help Scoobert
  save the city, and its burritos, from an evil warlock) — was only reachable via
  the hidden terminal `1101` command → `/1101.html`. It's now a real cabinet
  (`src/components/SaveSanDiego.tsx`): an `<iframe>` of the same shipped
  `public/1101.html`, gated behind a **PRESS START** button so the story's opening
  name-`prompt()` never fires until the player chooses to begin. Same DRY plumbing
  as the rest — one `arcadeGames.ts` registry row drives the in-world roll +
  the derived cross-link shelf + a standalone `/save-san-diego` route through
  `ArcadeCabinetPage` (route-parity + sitemap-parity guarded). Unlike the canvas
  cabinets it's a STORY (no score → the HUD reads QUEST); it's Luke's own content
  (© Scoobert Doobert), already a shipped asset, so no new provenance. `shoot:cabinet`
  covers the in-world roll (the soundmaker duck still fires — any open cabinet ducks
  the radio); **`shoot:savesandiego`** covers the standalone route both ways (JS-off
  crawlable shell w/ no iframe leak; JS-on PRESS START → iframe `/1101.html` → the
  real Twine story mounts).
  - **Patched six real logic bugs in the Twine game itself (Luke wrote it solo, no
    AI):** four **unbalanced-hook** passages (`zoogood`, `zoodecent`, `shopping`,
    `amuletattack`) — a missing `]` left an `(after:)` changer un-attached, which
    Harlowe rendered as a live red error box in-story; and two unitless
    `(after: 45)` → `(after: 4.5s)` (a bare number reads as ~45 **ms**, so the good-
    ending "Tails" link flashed in before its 3s "Heads" sibling). All verified
    error-free in the real Harlowe runtime (loaded each passage as the start node,
    asserted zero `tw-error` + the choice links render). No broken passage links
    (all 81 targets resolve). A fast static guard (`src/data/saveSanDiego.test.ts`)
    parses `public/1101.html` and pins those invariants (link targets resolve,
    balanced hooks, unitful `(after:)`) so the hand-edited export can't regress.
- ✅ **INTERACT-TO-PROGRESS + the 1101 LEVEL (2026-07-06, Luke: "escape rooms →
  doors appear after an ACTION, not just a key"):** the site's new default
  progression grammar — **do something trivially easy (click / grab) and the way
  onward APPEARS** — built on the EXISTING reveal hook (not a new mechanic), plus
  the 1101 quest promoted to its own full-screen LEVEL.
  - **The primitive:** a `hidden` door can now carry `revealOnTrigger` (ephemeral,
    re-armed per visit) alongside the durable `revealSecret`; a small clickable
    `Interactable` (`src/world/Interactables.tsx`, data: `Room.interactables`) fires
    a trigger via `sceneStore.fireTrigger`, and a pickup can bank a durable secret
    via `Item.revealsSecret`. The reveal's **juice**: a ding + a "a way opens" toast
    + a collect-burst at the interactable, and the door **shimmers into its wall**
    (DoorMesh grows a `hidden` door in on mount — a hidden door only ever mounts at
    its reveal moment, so mount == manifest). WCAG-safe (a smooth scale, no flash).
  - **ROOM ONE = the teacher:** the shop's "EMPLOYEES ONLY" back-hall door (the way
    deeper) is now HIDDEN until you **ring the counter bell** — the whole world's
    "interact → the way opens" language, set on the first room. The two SIDE doors
    (boardwalk / kitchen) stay visible so you're never blocked while you orient.
    (Wayfinding routes through `revealOnTrigger` doors so the compass still guides
    you deeper; genuine secrets — the rat's panel, the Möbius onward — stay off the
    map. The arrival-spawn contract skips `hidden` doors: inactive at arrival.)
  - **The 1101 LEVEL:** in the **Tape Vault**, pocketing the "1101" master reel
    (`Item.revealsSecret`) hums a door open in the wall behind it; **stepping
    through raises the full-screen text adventure** (`SaveSanDiegoLevel` →
    `sceneStore.levelOverlay`, a door with `opensLevel` opens an overlay instead of
    wiping to a room), with a "⟵ Return to the world" button + Esc (which also
    works from inside the same-origin story iframe) back out. The **arcade cabinet
    stays** (Luke: "keep both") — the cabinet is the quick/mobile way to play it;
    the level is the earned, immersive front door. `shoot:escaperoom` drives the
    whole thing (bell → hall reveal before/after; reel → level door → the real Twine
    story mounts in the overlay → return); `shoot:rooms` rings the bell first now.
- ✅ **Lyrics + the terminal's brain (2026-06-25):** verbatim **lyrics** for the
  catalog (`src/data/lyrics.*`) read along in the pause menu + the `lyrics`
  terminal command; **Love Music More** (`lmm`) and **lore** (`lore`) + a
  `discography` listing in the terminal — all mined + grep-verified from
  lukefwalton.com so the repo stays standalone.
- ✅ **The terminal surfaces the game layer (2026-06-26):** three new commands make
  the RPG layer legible + playable from the command line — `luck` (your banked luck +
  how the system spends it for D&D advantage; "be lucky"), `spells` (your spellbook +
  the key that casts each + your slot count), and `roll` (roll the universal d20 right
  there — your luck nudges it via advantage, a free peek that never spends). All PURE
  reads of the progress snapshot (commands.ts stays store-free); the pure d20 math was
  split into `src/lib/luck-core.ts` so a store-free command can roll, with `luck.ts`
  re-exporting it (every existing importer unchanged). `commands.test.ts` + `shoot:terminal`.
- ✅ **Real in-world VIDEO (`src/data/videos.ts`, 2026-06-25):** the CRTs now play
  the *right* clip, not one generic playlist. Each song/album carries a **verified**
  YouTube id (mined from `lukefwalton.com`, grep-checked — no hallucinated ids); a
  CRT resolves its clip through one chain — the song's OWN music video → its record's
  video → the general TV-spots channel — so a room declares only what it has
  (`tv.songSlug` / `tv.albumSlug`). Playlist-vs-video embeds are auto-detected
  (`ytEmbed`). **Memory Lane** (one live set in the corridor of dead web → the real
  MEMORY LAN MV) and **the server void** (the "all my friends" video) got CRTs;
  `albums.json` got `video` ids for 8 records. Covered by `videos.test.ts` (well-formed
  ids + the resolution chain + a room-CRT guard) and `shoot:tv`. "The reward for
  finding a song-room is its picture, too."

## ✅ GifCities pass — our own GIFs + retro furniture + the mobile gag (2026-06-26, PRs #76–#77)
The surface floors got the gaudy late-90s/GeoCities energy they were missing — all
ORIGINAL, no fetched artifacts (the agent proxy blocks archive.org / gifcities.org
anyway), which makes the joke land harder: a 2026 site that PRINTS its own 1999 GIFs.
- ✅ **A hand-rolled GIF89a encoder, zero deps (`scripts/lib/gif89a.mjs`):** indexed
  palette, animation frames w/ per-frame delay, NETSCAPE2.0 looping, and correct
  variable-width LZW (the Weiner/omggif code-width timing — an off-by-one here
  desyncs a real decoder at the first width bump, which a self-consistent test would
  miss). `make-gifs.mjs` generates the assets; `gif89a.test.mjs` round-trips every
  frame; **`shoot:gifs` decodes each GIF in real Chromium** (the spec oracle that
  caught that width-bump bug) and rewraps every later frame's verbatim bytes to
  validate them too. Fail-fast palette-index validation; spec-correct LSD color bits.
- ✅ **This pass's four original GIFs** (later passes grew `public/gifs/` well
  past four — the NEW! blinky, @-mail, globe, and leaderboard trio below): a
  bopping **dancing-pizza** (the site's
  "dancing baby"), a scrolling **construction** caution-bar, a shimmering **rainbow
  `<hr>`**, and a tiled **starfield wallpaper** — each animated GIF paired with a
  1-frame `*-static.gif` served under `prefers-reduced-motion` via `<picture>` (a
  GIF can't be paused in CSS, so the still IS the WCAG 2.3.1 accommodation).
- ✅ **Retro floor furniture (1999/2000, original CSS in the GifCities grammar):** a
  twinkling sparkle divider, an animated under-construction barber-pole, a green-LCD
  hit counter, "BEST VIEWED IN…" badges, a Pizza Webring (real prev/hub/next
  anchors), a spinning @-mail. The 1999 floor wears the starfield wallpaper (dark →
  the floor's light text gains contrast). Verified no horizontal overflow at 390px.
- ✅ **Mobile "try desktop" gag (`MachineRoomFloor`, PR #77):** on a real handheld
  (`isTouchDevice()` = `pointer: coarse`; originally `≤768px` + coarse), the Calzone
  Player install pops
  a period "Setup" notice — the plug-in was built for a desktop, *pocket phones didn't
  exist in 1996*. **UPDATE ("make the whole thing work on mobile"):** now that the 3D
  world runs on phones, the gag is a **wave-through pre-roll** — its primary button is
  "Enter the world ▶" (fires the real install), with `/text` kept as the secondary
  link (a real `<a>`, never a dead end). Accessible modal: focus trap, Escape,
  backdrop dismiss, focus restore; a resized desktop window (fine pointer) skips it and
  enters the world directly. `shoot:descent` covers both sides of the boundary + every
  dismissal path.
- ✅ **"Sign My Guestbook!" — a real anchor, not décor (follow-up PR):** the 1999
  marquee has teased "★ SIGN OUR GUESTBOOK ★" since launch with nowhere to go; the
  starburst floor now carries a real **`<a>` → the `contact` destination** (the
  webmaster who "reads every comment" = the guestbook contract), so the promise is
  finally crawlable, never a `#`. Beside it, a **"NEW!" blinky** printed by our own
  encoder — `new-badge.gif` from `make-gifs.mjs` (a 5px hand-set font, the encoder's
  one non-font-free exception), 2 frames at ~1.1 Hz with a <0.1 luminance swing and a
  `*-static` twin under reduced motion (triply WCAG 2.3.1-safe). `shoot:gifs` decodes
  both new frames in real Chromium; navy-on-gold button ≈ 10:1 contrast; no 390px
  overflow.
- ✅ **The 2000-floor @-mail is now a printed GIF (follow-up PR):** the CSS-spun "@"
  is replaced by `atmail.gif` from our own encoder — a little envelope that bobs with
  a pulsing red "1" badge (you've got mail), still wrapping the real `mailto` anchor.
  WCAG 2.3.1: a 1–2px bob + 1px badge pulse (no flash/blink), `*-static` twin under
  reduced motion. `shoot:gifs` validates all 6 frames in Chromium; no 390px overflow.

## ✅ Arcade gameplay pass — interactive music, walk-over pickups, PIZZA POINTS + a leaderboard (2026-06-28)
The "make it a fun game you come back to" pass (Luke). Four chunks, each its own
commit + smoke:
- ✅ **Music never steps on itself** (`audio/engine.ts`): every loop-voice swap now
  CROSSFADES (per-source gains; the outgoing source fades + frees itself, the
  incoming fades up) instead of hard-cutting, and `playJukeboxTrack` short-circuits
  when the requested url is already the live voice (no restart-from-top when a
  song-room's song == your pick, or RoomMusic races `restorePreferred`). `shoot:music`
  asserts the same-URL guard via a `__sdpLoopStarts` counter.
- ✅ **Walk-up + press-P pickups** (`world/PickupController.tsx`, `lib/pickups.ts`):
  one per-frame scan (like Doors) publishes the nearest collectible to
  `sceneStore.nearPickup` → a "Press P to grab …" prompt, and auto-grabs on
  walk-over once you've stepped off the spawn. Clicking still works; KEYS are
  excluded from auto-grab (intentional/puzzle items). The collect effect is shared
  (`collectInventoryItem`) so click / walk / P / the smoke hook can't double-collect.
- ✅ **PIZZA POINTS — the collectathon** (`data/loot.ts`, `state/scoreStore.ts`,
  `lib/loot.ts`, `world/LootPickup.tsx`): goofy loot (🍕🌯🍣🛹🏄) scattered
  DETERMINISTICALLY across every procedural room (seeded, inside the clamp, off
  spawns/doors; GLB levels skipped), respawning each descent. Grabbing one scores
  points × a combo (grabs inside a 2.5s window multiply, capped ×9), grows your eye
  height (`Controls` adds capped `tallness` — "lol taller"), and rings the next note
  of a climbing pentatonic scale (interactive music — collecting IS a melody). A
  top-right `ScoreHud` (points · live combo · % tall) + the per-grab toast; the
  durable best is `progressStore.pizzaPointsBest` (monotonic). `shoot:score` +
  `loot.test`/`scoreStore.test`.
- ✅ **The arcade leaderboard** (`api/score.ts`, `lib/leaderboard.ts`,
  `LeaderboardPanel`, `/leaderboard`): sign your best with three letters, no login,
  backed by **Vercel Blob** (one route, GET board + POST submit; honeypot +
  validation + a profanity blocklist; mirrors `api/order.ts`). Fully graceful — no
  serverless runtime in local preview just reads as "offline," never an error; your
  best is always kept locally. In the pause menu + a crawlable `/leaderboard` route
  (JS-off shell, postbuild-guarded). Dressed in **CRAZY original gifs** (a gleaming
  trophy, licking flames, raining coins — new in `make-gifs.mjs`/`shoot:gifs`, each
  with a reduced-motion `*-static` twin) over a starfield hall-of-fame.
  `shoot:leaderboard`.

## ✅ The day-off pass — jump, the garden wing + the Jumping Turtle (2026-07-04, from Luke's photo batch)
The "make it feel fun like a video game" pass, built from Luke's reference photos
(a Balboa-Park-ish garden walk + urbex footage of the real dead venue):
- ✅ **LEARNABLE SKILLS + JUMP (game feel):** movement verbs are now **earned
  collectibles**, not silent grants — a glowing **skill orb** (`world/SkillOrb.tsx`)
  you walk into for an "ooo, a skill" burst + rising fanfare + a durable once-only
  grant (`data/abilities.ts` is the registry: id → secret/name/hint/glyph/colour).
  The ladder:
  - **JUMP** is learned in the **FIRST room** (the beach shop orb, in view of the
    spawn) — the starter exploration verb, so the world is springy from the start.
    A simple ballistic arc in `Controls` (holding Space bunny-hops), clamped under
    each room's ceiling, and Space never steals focus from inputs/buttons (the
    keydown handler fully bails on a focused control).
  - **DOUBLE JUMP** is the upgrade, earned deep out at the **Jumping Turtle** (its
    stage orb — the pun: it teaches you to jump *again*, in mid-air). Edge-triggered
    (a fresh mid-air press), gated on its own secret.
  - Coverage: `shoot:skills` (shop — no hop → learn orb → hop, cold), `shoot:turtle`
    (learn double off the stage orb → proves it clears a single hop), `shoot:garden`
    (jump mechanic + Space-on-focused-UI does-nothing + enter-the-slide-mid-hop).
- ✅ **Pickup / learn JUICE:** a shared collect-burst pool (`world/CollectBursts.tsx`
  + the `burstBus` mailbox) pops a flash + expanding ring + sparks wherever anything
  is grabbed — loot, inventory items, and skill orbs all emit on the same signal
  (so every collect path — click / walk-over / P / a skill orb — gets the juice).
  WCAG-safe (one soft expand+fade, no strobe; world-only, already reduced-motion
  gated).
- ✅ **The garden wing** — three sweet SURFACE rooms west off the Park Path:
  - **The Botanical Garden (植物園):** trimmed hedge quadrants, pink-brick paths,
    a seeded scatter of random palms, the verdigris **FROG statue** with its
    lily-pad parasol (click → ribbit + squash-and-stretch hop; every ribbit rolls
    a plain d20 and a nat 20 winks **+1 LUCK**), and **THE TUBE SLIDE** — a
    play-place corkscrew that's a real RIDE: walk into the mouth and the camera
    is swallowed and carried through the tube (slide-whistle voice glisses with
    height via `audio.startVoice`, FOV kicks with speed), each ride scoring
    **pizza points through the loot combo path** (rides chain the combo) and the
    first ride banking a durable secret + luck ("Ride the tube slide" is a new
    pause-menu objective). The ride freezes world input (`rideState` →
    `inputFrozen`). **It's a COIN FLIP (Luke): ~half the time it WARPS you down
    into the hidden tube warren (below), the rest it loops you back out into the
    garden with a "↺ care to ride again?" nudge** (the loop-back keeps its exit
    heading via `cameraRig`, so no snap; a `?debug` hook forces the outcome for
    the smoke). A `musicRoom` (birdsong / breeze / a distant bullfrog).
  - **The Tubes (チューブ):** the hidden PlayPlace crawl-warren the slide drops you
    into — translucent green tube tunnels arcing overhead, glowing bubble
    portholes, a low-poly BALL PIT, scattered pizza-point loot, first-drop luck.
    Pure nostalgia (below SAFE); a `musicRoom` (soft rubbery bloops). A +Z tube
    mouth crawls back out to the garden.
    The slide geometry is built **programmatically** (`buildPath`: a swallow leg
    + a ¾-turn descending helix around an explicit tower) so the tube can't
    self-intersect into a blob — replaced a hand-authored path that did.
  - **The Grotto (洞窟):** the cave behind the north hedge — dark boulders, a
    still pool, and the MOUTH framing bright pond + a scrolling waterfall + a
    palm (the whole room is the view out). Echoey long-decay drips ("even more
    reverb," as the menu promised), `CeilingDrips`, first-entry +1 luck.
  - **The Bamboo Grove (竹林):** through the garden's stone **LION moon-gate**
    (rock ring + carved lion keystone) into a dense seeded stand of culms, a
    stone lantern, and a **shishi-odoshi whose tip-and-CRACK animation and klok
    are one event** (the whisper does the 鹿威し/獅子 lion-vs-deer pun).
    First-entry +1 luck.
- ✅ **The Jumping Turtle** — the defunct all-ages venue off North Park (San
  Marcos; Luke played it in high school). Eerie-WARM (unease 0.08 — memory, not
  menace): flyer-crusted entry wall, debris, the loft, dead amp stacks, the bar —
  and the stage under the **leaping-turtle sign** where the **shipped DrumKit
  still plays**; step up to the **mic stand** and the room remembers (a soft
  ghost-cheer; first time = durable secret + 2 luck + the "Play the Turtle one
  more time" objective); the **BROKEN CRT** buzzes and flickers one soft gray
  pulse but never becomes a picture — the one set in the world that doesn't play.
  A `musicRoom`: mains hum, a far-off kick-check, a rare feedback sigh. The
  double-jump orb sits UP on the riser, off the mic line, so you earn it by
  stepping onto the stage (not from the floor path).
- ✅ **The Main Street wing + the liminal day/night kitchen loop (Luke's idea):**
  off North Park (+X):
  - **Main Street (`world/MainStreetRoom.tsx`):** an empty small-town-America
    street at dead of night — seeded dark storefronts w/ the odd lit window, a
    slow-blinking amber caution light, a wobbling streetlamp, power poles, the
    diner's warm doorway glow. The biggest surface tickle (unease 0.12) but still
    warm-uncanny. A `musicRoom` (night hum / cricket / the light's tick).
  - **The All-Night Diner (`world/DinerRoom.tsx`):** checker floor, chrome counter
    + stools, booths, a pie case, a slow ceiling fan, a buzzing sign — and a row
    of low-poly **taxidermy animal heads that swivel to WATCH you** (tracked in
    the mount's local frame; a soft continuous look, never a jump). Warm-uncanny
    (0.07); first-entry luck.
  - **The day/night flip:** the diner's **kitchen** (dream-logic: its kitchen IS
    the shop's) has a **back door that lets you out onto Main Street in BROAD
    DAYLIGHT** — the SAME street (`mainstreetday`, kind `mainstreet`, day palette;
    `MainStreetRoom` renders the day variant off the id) at a hazy overexposed
    noon. In the back at night, out the front at noon. Loops back to North Park.
  - Covered by **`shoot:mainstreet`** (real northpark→mainstreet→diner→kitchen→
    back-door→day edges; the day flip). WCAG-safe: all blinks are slow smooth
    fades, no strobe.
- Wiring: `ROOM_MAP` nodes, `dread.ts` bases (all garden rooms below SAFE; the
  Turtle just past it), perception whispers for all four rooms, two new quests
  (+ their unit-test flips; `shoot-objective` seeds them done), `rooms.test`
  arrival-spawn contracts hold. Covered by **`shoot:garden`** (jump, real
  balboa⇄garden + garden⇄grotto + bamboo→garden edges, ribbit, the full ride
  state machine) and **`shoot:turtle`** (real northpark⇄turtle edges, drums,
  broken-CRT no-modal guard, the walk-to-mic cheer).

## Open hygiene / notes
- **Docs reconciliation pass (2026-07-07):** a drift audit of the three governing
  docs + README against the code fixed 7 stale claims — jukebox `*.wav` → `*.mp3`
  (CLAUDE/DESIGN), DESIGN's "four tracks" → the real catalog, the trap-door and
  grass-encounter DESIGN sections re-tagged SHIPPED, the spinning-globe "still
  open" line closed, README's hard-coded "seven cabinets" replaced with a pointer
  at the `arcadeGames.ts` registry, and the "Four original GIFs" line rescoped to
  its pass. Rule of thumb reaffirmed: don't hard-code counts a registry/catalog
  owns — point at the source of truth.
- **CI + smoke gate (shipped):** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs typecheck +
  build + `npm run shoot:all` (auto-discovers every `shoot:*`, one preview, retry-
  once). A `shoot`/`shoot:*` script == a CI-gating smoke; non-gating helpers must
  avoid that prefix. Shared smoke flows live in `scripts/lib/smoke.mjs`. See
  `README.md` → Self-verification.
- **Repo DRY (shipped):** the PS1 `flatMat` material helper is one export in
  `src/world/ps1.ts` (was copy-pasted into 13 rooms); the `?world`/`?debug` smoke
  globals all route through `src/lib/testHooks.ts` (`isTestEntrance` /
  `exposeTestGlobal`); the arcade cabinet set is one registry (`arcadeGames.ts`)
  the shelf derives from + a route-parity test guards (no parallel lists drift).
  The PS1 grass-texture + seeded-scatter (`makeGrassTexture` / `seededRandom`) and
  the bilingual sign factory (`makeBilingualSign`) are single exports in `ps1.ts`,
  and a `useDispose(...resources)` hook (`src/lib/useDispose.ts`) replaces the
  hand-spelled `useEffect(() => () => […].dispose())` cleanup across the world
  components (now rolled out — 41 effects across 29 components; store/mixed/
  setup-bearing effects are deliberately left as real `useEffect`s).
- **Repo code-quality pass (shipped, 2026-06-29):** a focused clean/DRY sweep on
  its own branch. The PS1 nearest-texture finalizer (`nearestify`) and the bought-
  GLB material re-treat (`ps1ifyGltfMaterial`) are now single exports in
  `src/world/ps1.ts` — the same 3-liner had been copy-pasted across ~12 rooms plus
  both GLB files — and `PS1.snap` is the real snap source now, not an unused
  constant. The arcade cross-link shelf is one registry-derived `CabinetShelf`
  component (the four older cabinet pages had drifted, silently dropping links to
  shipped cabinets — the exact failure the `arcadeGames.ts` registry exists to
  prevent). A shared `ExternalLink` replaces the per-page `target="_blank"`
  helpers; the client/server initials sanitizers collapsed to one `cleanInitials`,
  and the terminal `song`/`lyrics` lookups to one `fuzzyFindSlug`. Dead CSS
  (`.boot__skip`, `.world-exit`) removed; `shoot.mjs` migrated onto the shared
  harness; an `.editorconfig` (aligned with `.prettierrc`) added. Deliberately
  left alone: the vendored-standalone `cultures.ts` note table (the standalone
  guardrail) and the `progressStore` spend counters (the persistence spine — the
  tiny dup reads clearer than a cast-laden helper). typecheck / lint / format /
  518 unit tests / `shoot:all` all green.
- **Mobile audit (shipped):** `shoot:mobile` loads every URL-addressable surface
  (storefront, `/text`, `/links`, `/about`(+`/jp`), `/leaderboard`, all the arcade
  cabinets) at a 390×844 phone viewport and fails on horizontal overflow, with a
  full-page screenshot each for eyeballing. The descent era-floors stay covered by
  `shoot:descent`'s mobile pass. (Audit found the routable surfaces already clean —
  the dead-plain storefront's small inline links are intentional, per the
  constitution — so this locks that in as a regression guard.) The guard also
  covers the `/chimes` + `/cultures` instrument buttons (now a 44px min-height tap
  target — WCAG 2.5.5), and every full-height surface carries a `100dvh` fallback
  so the iOS dynamic toolbar doesn't leave a seam at the fold.
- **Component decomposition (shipped):** the 825-line `WorldHud` was split into
  self-sufficient children — `WelcomeOverlay`, `SpellHotbar`, `PauseMenu` — each
  reading its own store slices, so the HUD is no longer a monolith.
- **Repo cleanup pass (shipped):** refreshed the stale docs (the README Status now
  defers to this file instead of re-rotting; `boot.wav`→`boot.mp3`; the copyright
  note reflects that third-party GLBs ship with `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES` rows);
  deleted the empty `fun/` breadcrumb dir (instruments long since vendored —
  provenance kept in the `chimes.ts` header); added a real 1.91:1 **OG card**
  (`scripts/make-og-card.mjs` → `scoobert-og-card.jpg`) so social unfurls stop
  cropping the square photo; added a **`sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt`** guarded in
  sync with `routes.tsx` (`src/sitemap.test.ts`); removed two dead store selectors.
- **Media reorg (done on `main`, 2026-06-20):** source media now nests under
  `media/` (`media/masters`, `media/music/<year>`, `media/photos`, `media/sfx`,
  and the GLB troves under `media/models/<category>`). Old loose root folders are
  gone. Only degraded/web-sized derivatives under `public/` ship.
- **Review-bot loop:** runs ~3 min after a push and **edits its single comment in
  place** — no webhook fires for the edit, so don't rely on webhooks. After
  pushing, do other work, then re-fetch the PR comment via the GitHub API and act
  on it. Known false positive: it flags `/PIZZA.png` as a 404 (truncated diff);
  the file IS in `public/` → `dist/`. Ignore it.
- **Self-verify with Playwright** before visual checkpoints: `npm run shoot`
  (incl. JS-disabled), `shoot:world`, `shoot:descent`, `shoot:rooms`,
  `shoot:fallback`, `shoot:gifs`.

## What's next (planned, as of 2026-06-26)
Candidate next chunks — no fixed order, pick by appetite (and re-check the SCOPE
guardrail before anything that adds a place/NPC/system):
- **Mobile polish sweep.** ✅ Largely done in **"make the whole thing work on
  mobile"**: the 3D WORLD itself now runs on phones (touch controls), and
  `shoot:mobile` passes with zero horizontal overflow across every URL-addressable
  surface (storefront, 1999/2000 floors, `/text`, jukebox, the arcade routes).
  Still open (nice-to-have): fine-tune the in-world HUD crowding at phone scale
  (the objective chip / menu button / combo readouts sit close together up top) and
  add per-room touch-walk coverage beyond the beach shop that `shoot:touch` drives.
- **More GeoCities fun.** ✅ The **"Sign My Guestbook"** anchor (→ `contact`), the
  **"NEW!" blinky**, and the printed **@-mail envelope** GIF all shipped (above).
  ✅ The **spinning WORLD WIDE WEB globe** shipped too (`public/gifs/globe.gif`,
  a real `<a href="/links">` on the 1999 floor — `StarburstFloor.tsx`). Still open:
  more **blinkies** on other surfaces, a flame divider — extend the retro furniture
  while adding real nav anchors, not just decoration. Reuses the GIF89a encoder
  (`make-gifs.mjs`) already in the repo.
- **3D world delight.** ✅ First beat shipped — the **pizza pan chimes** "play it"
  instrument in the park (above); ✅ and **The Aerial** — the deep proximity-played
  theremin room (the music ladder's first SUSTAINED voice). More to feed the
  "exploration's reward is sound"
  spine on desktop — another easter-egg, a room touch, or an NPC beat. The biggest
  open backlog (Phase 8 tail) is **further album-themed wings.**
- **Close the small tails.** ✅ The Phase 3 mobile/README note is closed (the
  mobile 3D + touch-controls work above). The Phase 7 instruments tail is the loose
  end still flagged in the table above.
- **Tooling DRY — the smoke harness.** ✅ Shipped — the Playwright bootstrap +
  teardown now live in `scripts/lib/smoke.mjs` (`launchSmoke` / `startSmoke` +
  the `fail`/`finish` counter), and every `shoot:*` smoke routes through them. The
  last straggler (`shoot.mjs`) was migrated in the repo code-quality pass below.
