# media/models/ — 3D source models (NOT shipped)

Raw `.glb` source models, grouped by what they're for. These are **unoptimized
source** downloads/scans. Nothing here is served directly: per the project
constraints you **crunch each model to PS1 fidelity** (`gltf-transform` →
vertex-snap-friendly, ≤128px `NearestFilter` textures, no mipmaps) and only the
**optimized derivative** lands in `public/models/` for shipping.

This file is the manifest: clean filename, the original filename it came from
(provenance), and notes. Group blurbs map to the roadmap in
[`../../docs/PHASES.md`](../../docs/PHASES.md) (asset direction in
[`../../docs/DESIGN.md`](../../docs/DESIGN.md)).

## ⚠️ Licensing — read before shipping anything

These are third-party downloads/scans. **Verify each model's individual license
and attribution before any public build**, and log credits in a
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Several models depict **other people's intellectual
property** and must **not** ship in a public build — they're kept only as
private style reference / placeholders, to be replaced with original parody
assets. Those are marked **⚠️ IP** below.

This squares with CLAUDE.md's #1 non-negotiable ("No copyrighted assets, copy,
logos, or marks… original parody only"): keeping them as local reference is
fine; shipping them is not.

## `mobius/` — Möbius-strip motif
Decorative motif threaded through the world to plug Luke's album *Mobius*.

## `greek-vaporwave/` — vaporwave-Greek statuary
For the **level below the shop** (Phase 3+). Columns, sculptures, lyre, jar,
mountains. (The previous hand-built site — including its Julius Caesar "bust" —
is preserved in git history, not the working tree. See `README.md`.)

## `water/` — water & pool
Sea / pool surfaces. NB: the beach-shop water is currently **procedural**
(`src/world/Water.tsx`); these are alternates and feed the pool level.

## `doors/` — doors & exit signage
"Doors everywhere" — the connective tissue between floors and rooms. Numbered
simply (`door-1`…`door-10`); the **what it is** column keeps each one's original
identity so nothing's lost. Several distinct looks kept on purpose.

| file | ← original | what it is |

## `crt-tvs/` — CRT televisions
For the SGI machine room (the live-render CRT; cf. `src/world/MiniWorldPreview.tsx`).
`crt-tv-lowpoly.glb` (~0.1MB) is already PS1-ready.

## `animatronics/` — animatronic horror (Phase 5 dread)
For the lower / dread levels (the rat turns, the machine sees you). Surface
levels stay goofy; save these for depth.

| `customizable-animatronics-fazbear.glb` | `customizable_animatronics__fazbear.glb` | **⚠️ IP** — "Fazbear" = *Five Nights at Freddy's*. Reference only; don't ship. |

Full environments staged for the levels below the shop (Phase 3+): the pool
level + backrooms direction.
